## Main objective of Catchimal

- Encourage to get involved with nature completing a virtual album of animals together with your friends.

## Features of the project

#### Social Media

Allows to see your friends registered animals, comment, and chat with them. Join your friends to explore the outside and the unknown.

#### Animal Album

You would have an album for storing the animals you have taken photos of in your life.

#### Photo Information

Catchimal is using GCP services to automatically recognize your animal information. Furthermore, you will see where, when, and how the photography was taken.

#### Animal Learning

See information and curious facts about the animals around you, chatting with AI chatbot. You would learn how to protect our nature and be sustainable.

#### Gamifier

It would be like a game, like a real Pokedex. Obtain points and rewards for taking pictures of exotic animals.

#### Shared Environment

Share albums between friends, showing the things around you.

#### User Account

See progress, status, points, challenges, rewards, and more!

#### Interact with your Animals on AR

Win points in a different way when there aren't more animals near. Play, feed or combat with your animals.

## How we built it - Milestone we have achieved

* We made a mobile react native app and a react landing webpage. 
* Use of Google Cloud Storage for uploading the animals photographs. 
* Google Vision, Cloud functions and GCP services for recognize animal data.
* User can login, take a photo, and see some basic information about the animal identified by Google Vision.
* UiPath used for making test users.

## Challenges we ran into

* Lack of time.
* Defining task between team members.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of

* The first page on React of one of our members.

* We think that Catchimal is a really cool idea, but do not know how to make it reality and used by real users.

## What we learned

* Some members worked with technologies that they have never worked like React, React Native, Google Cloud Platform or GitHub organizations.

* Learned team work and communication.

## What's next for Catchimal - To be done

* Allow to avatarize animals on users album.

* Add interactions and games with the AR animals.

* Chats between users.

* Add challenges and multiple albums, ordered by difficulty, to be completed.

* Complete and enhance the functionalities.

* Make a working chatbot that provides the required information by the user for each animal.

* For future plans, it is going to be a complete social media, a game like Pokemon Go, and a platform with a chatbot AI for deep information about the animals.
